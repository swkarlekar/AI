                             Problem solving in AI is fundamentally a search.

PROGRAMMING NOTES.
   1. Short of brute force (finding all paths) there is no known optimal algorithm for the traveling salesman
      problem (aka TSP), for a set of random points of any size. So we seek an algorithm that 1) is quick to
      run, and 2) will give us a short path length, but not necessarily the shortest.

   2. How do we find such an algorithm? Or, again, what do we do when we don't know what to do? We make up
      examples and think about the examples. We try to recall or invent similar kinds of problems--e.g., in-
      stead of the most efficient solution, find the most inefficient solution. Programming a poor idea may
      give us a good idea for another algorithm. BTW, it is extremely important that you display any path you
      create visually on the screen in order to gain new ideas.

   3. If a path crosses itself, the length can be shortened.     A   B                   A---B
      This immediately follows from the Triangle Inequality       \ /|                       |
      Theorem. You can prove this freshman geometry                / |                       |
      problem, can't you? [The truth is that this took me         / \|                       |
      a couple minutes of frustration until I realized           D   C                   D---C
      that the solution was "obvious".]                    poor path = ACBD     shorter path = ABCD
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HISTORY. The first reference in the mathematical literature is a colloquium talk in 1930, when the Austrian
   mathematician Karl Menger discussed the "messenger problem", which is the same as the TSP, except the
   messenger, who visits every city, does not need to return home. Although the problem was known in the
   mathematics community, no progress was made for nearly 20 years. The first mention of the name "traveling
   salesman problem" comes from a 1949 paper by the mathematician Julia Robinson. In 1954, the optimal
   solution for a particular 49-city problem was solved. It was a route from Washington D.C through major
   cities in each of the 48 states returning to D.C. Skipping ahead, through many minor successes with this
   problem, in 2006, the problem was solved in general for 85,900 random points.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADVICE.
   1. The data in your program will be a list of xy-coordinates. Make it a list of lists, not tuples. And
      append an id in the zeroth position--e.g.,

              city = [[id, x, y], [id, x, y], ..., [id, x, y]]

      Then x, y = city[n][1], city[n][2]. Why a make list of lists instead of a list of tuples? Because you
      don't know if you will later need to modify the components, and tuples are immutable. Why append an id?
      Because you don't know if you will later need to give your xy-coordinates an attribute.

   2. Recall the 2-D distance function is built-in in Python: hypot(3,4) = 5. Since we are working with city
      points, create a dist function that will accept two cities--NOT xy-coordinates--and return their
      distance. Since my city points look like this: city[n] = [id, x, y], I wrote this function:

                            def dist(cityA, cityB):
                                return hypot(cityA[1]-cityB[1], cityA[2]-cityB[2])

   3. Here is a KEY DESIGN OBSERVATION. We are working with cities, which are at least a pair of xy-coordin-
      ates, and in my case a city is a triple: city[n] = [id, x, y]. Consequently, we want to write functions
      (create tools) that accept city parameters, NOT xy-coordinates. This policy will tend to keep us away
      from nested subscripts (ouch!) and triply subscripted variables (ouch, again!). The dist function above
      is an example of the policy.

   4. The data for this problem consists of all float numbers. It may be an advantage to cast them all as
      integers, until the program is finished. Why? Because 1) ints line up easier for inspection during
      debugging, 2.) it is easier to tell-by-looking if two ints differ than two floats, and 3) you cannot
      directly compare floats for equality.

   5. Finally, watch for two particular errors: OBOEs (off-by-one errors), and aliases (two variables sharing
      the same place in memory). When in doubt, use deepcopy.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE MOORE PRINCIPLE (R.L. Moore, 1882-1974). You must neither obtain ideas from others, nor check the Internet
   when solving problems. Only after you have programmed up your own ideas do you seek out what others have
   done. (Questions of syntax are excepted.) The advantages of following this principle are multiple:

                   1. We mature as problem solvers.
                   2. We appreciate the clever ideas of others.
                   3. We remember ideas that can be used in future problems.
                   4. We become more confident in ourselves.

   THE FIRST RULE OF PROBLEM SOLVING is--in my opinion--to come to each problem with a history of working out
   challenging problems on your own. You cannot quit on pesky problems or you won't have that history. You
   cannot stop working on problems or you won't have enough of that history. Lucky is the obsessed person, who
   isn't working at all, only playing. Good luck.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ASSIGNMENT.  Code up the following algorithms and print their four lengths in a visually attractive chart.

   Algorithm 1. (Random) Call Python's shuffle instruction to randomize the order of the cities in the list.
                Then create a path by connecting the cities in the order they occur in the file. Don't forget
                to connect the final city back to the initial city.

                [This will be a terrible solution, don't you think? A waste of time, too. Argg! Don't be so
                quick to judge. This "solution" has the obvious advantages of being fast and easy to code. It
                also gets us moving on the problem--both thinking and coding, especially working with
                graphics. It begs the question: could there be a worse solution?  Yes. Can we find it? Yes,
                but why? Because the opposite of a poor solution might be a good solution. So we have learned
                another lesson. Initially coding up a poor algorithm can be a productive way to start
                searching for a good algorithm.]

   Algorithm 2. (Sort on x) Sort the tuples and then connect them in the order they occur in the re-ordered
                city list. Remember to connect the last city with the first city. Look closely at the image.
                Can you think of a way to shorten the total length?

   Algorithm 3. (Sort on y) Isn't this essentially the same as sorting on x? Yes, but we wonder if the path
                lengths are significantly different. The trick, of course, is just to switch the x- and y-
                values and then call the exact same functions to display the graph.

   Algorithm 4. Your algorithm. There are many ways to attack this problem. Don't worry about finding an
                efficient method, because we are interested in why some methods that sound good are not good
                at all.

   The program given below should work and display the shuffled data. The rest is up to you
